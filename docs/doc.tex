\section{Assignment}
The task in hand is to assemble a mechanical device and create software for acquiring 2D hand geometry via a line camera. A solution for mounting the camera and hand placement should be proposed in the following sections for best geometry acquisition and image reconstruction.

The document is structured as follows: in section \ref{sec:hw} we describe the hardware part of the project, what hardware was used and we propose a solution for camera mount and hand placement. In section \ref{sec:sw} the software needed for camera control and image reconstruction is presented. In section \ref{sec:db} we detail the created hand geometry database and how we acquired it and in last two sections \ref{sec:res} and \ref{sec:sum} we sum up the proposed hardware and software solution and what further work can be done.
