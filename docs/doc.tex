\section{Assignment}
The aim of the project is to assemble a mechanical device and create software for acquiring 2D hand geometry using a line camera.
A solution for camera mount and hand placement is proposed in the following sections for best geometry acquisition and image reconstruction.

The document is structured as follows: in section \ref{sec:hw} we describe the hardware part of the project, what hardware was used
and we describe a solution for camera mount and hand placement. In section \ref{sec:sw} we present the software needed for camera control and image reconstruction.
In section \ref{sec:db} we detail created database of hand geometry data and method of acquisition. In last two sections \ref{sec:res}
and \ref{sec:sum} we sum up hardware and software solution and propose further improvements on our solution.

\section{Achieved Results}
\label{sec:res}
Solution described in this report was assembled and implemented with excellent results. Integration of all hardware parts and software control results
in images being scanned quickly in resolution exceeding 60 MPx. During testing it was proved to be effective to not only scan images
of hand geometry but also fingerprints which leads to general purpose sensoric solution for capturing multiple biometric data. Furthermore,
the solution is able to function with very limited resources necessary and provides instant access to scanned images via a web serber. Complete scan of both of the subject's
hands can be done under 1 minute.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:sum}
As previously dicussed in \ref{sec:res} proposed solution is able to quickly and accurately provide 2D hand geometry in great resolution. Solution was
used to create initial image database with emphasisis on ease of use and precision so this database can be quickly expanded.

Solution proved to be effective to not only capture 2D hand geometry but also capture other biometric data such as fingertip scans. This results in
ability to make multiple models from data and design efficient classification and identification algorhitms.

Improvements to this solution in the future could mean even better precision in acquiring image scans such as use of antivibration materials on
slide platform to remove slight dillatations in images, enhancement of hand positioning using pillar to increase similarities between images.
Also a speed optimisation could be done by acquiring another image when the slider with camera is on its way back to initial position, it could possibly scan another hand or the other
side of the same hand, which would theoretically result in double the speed of acquiring samples.
Further work should focus on solidifying the whole structure while making it more compact.
With a second line camera the system can be expanded to capture 3D hand geometry. With acquired data the system be expanded for biometric identification and verification.
