\section{Assignment}
The aim of the project is to assemble a mechanical device and create software for acquiring 2D hand geometry via a line camera.
A solution for camera mount and hand placement is proposed in the following sections for best geometry acquisition and image reconstruction.

The document is structured as follows: in section \ref{sec:hw} we describe the hardware part of the project, what hardware was used
and we describe a solution for camera mount and hand placement. In section \ref{sec:sw} we present the software needed for camera control and image reconstruction.
In section \ref{sec:db} we detail created database of hand geometry data and method of acquisition. In last two sections \ref{sec:res}
and \ref{sec:sum} we sum up hardware and software solution and propose further improvements on our solution.

\section{Achieved Results}
\label{sec:res}
Solution described in this report was assembled and implemented with excellent results. Integration of all hardware parts and software control results
in images being scanned very quickly in great resolution. During testing it was proved to be effective to not only scan images
of hand geometry but also fingerprints which leads to general purpose sensoric solution for capturing multiple biometric data. Furthermore,
solution is able to function with very limited resources necessary and provides instant access to scanned images.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:sum}
\todo[inline]{preciznost HW, vylepsenie - antivibracna podlozka, 3d geometria, distancne stlpky a palcement ruky}
As previously dicussed in \ref{sec:res} proposed solution si able to quickly and accurately provide 2D hand geometry in great resolution. Solution was
used to create initial image database with emphasisis on ease of use and precision so this database can be quickly expanded.
Solution proved to be effective to not only capture 2D hand geometry but also capture other biometric data such as fingertip scans. This results in
ability to make multiple models from data and design efficient classification and identification algorhitms.
