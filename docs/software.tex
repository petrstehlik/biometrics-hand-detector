\section{Software}
Hardware solution for proposed device consists from three main parts: moving slide on rail, camera and light.
Each of these parts needs to be controlled in order to scan images of hand geometry.
All of the software as well as webserver storing results runs on control module - Raspberry Pi.

\subsection{Used Software}
Software is implemented in python language for its ease of use and comprehension. With all necessary software running
on Raspbery Pi minimum setup is necessary.

Slide platform is controlled through serial bus by writing to GPIO pins direction and enable signals.
Light is controlled via its XLC4 controller through RS232 interface.
Light status is controlled through commands \texttt{LC A 1} and \texttt{LC A 0} for turning it on/off respectively.

\subsection{Acquiring Images}
To acquire images simple setup is necessary. Assembly and connection of all hardware parts is necessary with individual
parts connected to Raspberry Pi control module according to schematics. Raspberry control module needs to be setup and
software installed.
When Raspberry is connected to internet image acquisition can be done through remote access without need for whole desktop.
Firstly hand is placed on designated platform and then software is run. Firstly lights are switched on, then camera starts
recording and slide moves along the rail till it completes the scan. After scan slide moves to initial position and device
is immediately ready for another scan.
