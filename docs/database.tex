\section{Hand Geometry Database}
\label{sec:db}
Scanned images are stored directly on Raspberry Pi immedietly after capture. Images are exposed
through webserver and are availible for direct downlaod through web browser.

Image naming convention allows to distinguish between different takes just by storing time of
capture with filename as follows: result\_<timestamp> where timestamp means standart Unix timestamp.
High resolution images enable user to detect pores of sweat gland ducts in skin, whilst maintaining
up to 2 scans per minute in proposed solution.
